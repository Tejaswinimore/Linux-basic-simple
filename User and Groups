Adding a User
If you are signed in as the root user, you can create a new user at any time by typing:

# adduser newusername
If you are signed in as a non-root user who has been given sudo privileges, you can add a new user by typing:

$ sudo adduser newusername
Assign and confirm a password for the new user

Adding the New User to the Sudo Group
By default, sudo on Ubuntu 18.04 systems is configured to extend full privileges to any user in the sudo group.

You can see what groups your new user is in with the groups command:

$ groups user1
OUTPUT:

user1 : user1
Deleting a User
You can delete the user itself, without deleting any of their files, by typing the following command as root :

# deluser user1
or with sudo , type:

$ sudo deluser user1
Note:
you can use sudo -i to switch between users.

Create a User Group
To create a new group, enter the following:

sudo groupadd new_group
Use the adduser command to add an existing user to an existing group:

sudo adduser user_name new_group
use the useradd command to add a user to a group:

sudo useradd –G new_group user_name
Create a User and Add to Group:
sudo useradd –G new_group new_user
Next, assign a password to the new user:

sudo passwd new_user
The gpasswd tool is used for managing groups.

To remove a user from a group:

sudo gpasswd –d user_name new_group
Delete a Group
To delete a group, use the command:

sudo groupdel new_group
To display the groups that a user belongs to with the groups command:

groups
You can display groups for a different user by specifying the username:

groups other_user
or you can list all groups by

$ cat /etc/group
Set or change password for user
# passswd username
